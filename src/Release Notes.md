Alpha 5.5
=============================
- General Changes
  - Switched metrics to bStats as MCStats is no longer maintained
- Server Account
  - Ability to have a general server account.
    - You may configure the name used for this account in config.yml.
  - Ability to grant access to the server account's banks
  - Ability to take, give, and pay money to/from the server account's funds.
- Currency Changes
  - Added ability to change currency SI prefixes on a per currency basis.
  - Set a new cap on max number of decimal places that may be rounded to, which is now 4
  - Added ability to set max balance on a per currency basis, this is capped at the max balance size of 9 Quintillion
- Command Changes
  - Added /economy reset
    - This allows server administrators the ability to reset balances to their defaults based on certain parameters.
  - Added "economy" as a trigger for the eco commands.  
  - Made money-based arguments smarter
    - Added ability to parse short values from chat
      - This allows users to perform commands such as /pay <player> 1k, and it'll actually perform said action for the correct amount.
  - Added currency argument to /money pay    
- Technical
  - Changed the save format for balances
    - This allows us to have virtually unlimited balances, the cap is for memory control purposes.
    -(not really unlimited, but either way not having a limit would eat more than anything)
  - Made Eco ID searches case insensitive.
  - Maximum possible balance size is now 900 Decillion
    - This is better know as 900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
  - TNE now automatically detects, and supports mobs & blocks for their relevant configurations
    - This revents incompatibilities, and allows us to not have to release an update just to add new mobs/blocks from new Minecraft versions.
- API
  - Removed deprecated methods.
