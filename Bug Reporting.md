Bug Reporting
==================

So you've found a bug? At this point you're probably raging, throwing your mouse around the room, and ultimately cursing
creatorfromhell's existance. Now I know that software bugs are relatively new(since around the 1980s), but have no fear!
There's this new thing in the world call bug reporting. What is this "bug reporting" thing that you speak of? Well, it's
actually quite revolutionary. You see, all you do is click [here](https://github.com/TheNewEconomy/TNE-Bukkit/issues/new), fill out and submit the form, and it actually lets me
know of the issue. How fascinating!
