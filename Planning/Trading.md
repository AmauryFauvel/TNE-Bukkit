Trading
=======
Trading will most likely be released in its own version to allow for proper
implementation.

Commands
--------
/trade - base command
/trade <player> - Send a trade offer, or accept an existing offer to/from <player>

Features
--------
This will use a large double-chest like inventory layout.
There will be a dividing horizontal line of wool separating
each player's offer. In the middle of the dividing line there
will be a red, and green wool block for declining, and accepting
a trade respectively. There will also be three buttons for handling
the possibility of trading with currency. If a player accepts a trade,
but the other decides to modify said trade, the original player will
need to reevaluate, and determine whether or not to accept/decline
the new offer. Declining an offer at anytime will kick both players
out of the trade.
